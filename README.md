🧩 Introduction

DevDrawer is a full stack web application designed to help developers and teams plan, structure, and organize software projects in a visual and intuitive way.

It provides an interactive digital whiteboard where users can brainstorm ideas, design system architectures, create workflows, and manage development plans in one centralized workspace.

The platform combines drawing tools, note-taking features, and project organization capabilities, allowing users to transform abstract ideas into structured plans.

Each user has their own secure account, enabling them to create, edit, manage, and delete personal boards and planners.

DevDrawer is built with modern web technologies, focusing on performance, scalability, and clean architecture, while also serving as a practical learning project for full stack development.
